# Task 1:
# Define a new matrix to feed into Aseq that takes the previous yearâ€™s sea ice
# status into account.
# Make good years more likely if the previous year was good (use 20% likelihood),
# and conversely # makes bad ice years more likely if the previous year was
# bad (use 80% likelihood).

# Define 2 new parameters which describe the probability next year is a bad year
# given that this year was a good  (use 50% likelihood), and (b) describe the
# probability next year is a bad year given that this year was a bad year (use
# 80% likelihood again).
