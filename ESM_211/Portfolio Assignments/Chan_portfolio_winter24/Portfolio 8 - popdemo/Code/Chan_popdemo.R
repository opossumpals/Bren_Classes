# Task 1:
# Define a new matrix to feed into Aseq that takes the previous yearâ€™s sea ice status into account.
# Make good years more likely if the previous year was good (use 20% likelihood), and conversely
# make bad ice years more likely if the previous year was bad (use 80% likelihood).

# Task 2:
# Define 2 new parameters which describe the probability next year is a bad year
# given that this year was a good  (use 50% likelihood), and (b) describe the
# probability next year is a bad year given that this year was a bad year (use
# 80% likelihood again).

## projects polar bear population over time given the probability of good and bad ice years 
plot(polar_proj_2)

# When the probability that next year's ice will be bad given that this year will be good, results in a steep decline and 
# eventually a very low population size. When there is a lower probability that next year's ice will be bad given that 
# this year will be good, there is a steady decline over 20 years before crashing. Both scenarios end with very low polar
# bear population sizes and densities.
