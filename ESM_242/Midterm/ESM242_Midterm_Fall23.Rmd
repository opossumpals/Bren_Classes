## Question 1: Stand Externalities {.tabset}

This problem considers spatial interactions between two stands.  Suppose that the management of stand 1 affects the growth of stand 2.  This is a classic case of an externality. Depending on the specific setting, this could be a negative or positive externality whereby stand 1 reduces or increases the growth of stand 2.  I ask you to consider how the externality affects the solution to the optimal rotation length for stand 2 and to think about how policies could be designed to remedy the problem.

Suppose the yield functions for stand 1 and 2 are, respectively, $Q(T_1)=e^{a-b/T_1}$  and $Q(T_2,T_1^* )=e^{(a-b/T_2+dT_1^*} )$. The yield for stand 1 is the usual specification, but for stand 2, the yield depends on the age of the stand as well as the rotation length chosen for the first stand ($T_1^*$ ).  Note that the yield function for stand 2 depends on the rotation length $T_1^*$  and not on the current age of the stand $T_1$ .  While the latter formulation is more realistic, it is much harder to implement in this problem.  Define a=10, b=90, c=125, p=2.5, and $\delta$=0.03.

### A.

Using NLoptR and the parameter values given above, what is the optimal rotation length for stand 1 ( $T_1^*$) when the stand is grown for an infinite number of rotations?

<span style="color: blue;">**The optimal rotation length for stand 1 when grown for an infinite number of rotations is 48.258 rotations.**</span>

inf_rotation_s1_func <- function(choice, a, b, c, p, discount) {
  
  state <- vector(mode="numeric", length=0)
  benefits <- vector(mode="numeric", length=0)
  
  Q=exp(a-b/choice)
  benefits=(p*Q*exp(-discount*choice)-c)/(1-exp(-discount*choice))
  
  return(-benefits)
  
}

                 a=10, 
                 b=90, 
                 c=125,
                 p=2.5,
                 discount=0.03)

solution_1a <- round(out_1a$solution, 3)

```




### B.

Holding the rotation for stand 1 at the value of $T_1^*$  found in a, what are the optimal rotations (assume an infinite number of them) for stand 2 ($T_2^*$) for three different values of d: d=0, d=-0.03, d=0.1?  Explain the relationship between $T_2^*$ and $d$.

### C.

What are some real-world examples of negative and positive externalities that affect the growth of neighboring stands?  Describe some policy interventions that could be used to get the owner of stand 1 to internalize the effect of her stand on stand 2.  In order words, how could policies be used to get the owner of stand 1 to reduce negative externalities or increase positive externalities?  

<span style="color: blue;">**An example of a positive externality that affects the growth of neighboring stands is the benefits of carbon sequestration. When the first stand is grown for a longer time series, it is able to sequester more carbon. This in turn affects the second tree stand... An example of a negative externality is ...**.</span>





## Question 2: Stock Pollutant {.tabset}

This question builds on the stock pollutant example presented in class. The objective is to maximize the present value of net benefits (PVNB) from production $q_t$ of a good: 

$$
PVNB= \max_q \sum^{t=10}_{t=0}\rho^t(pq_t-(aZ_t-bZ_t^2))
$$
where $(aZ_t-bZ_t^2)$ are the damages from the stock pollution $Z_t$.  The maximization problem is subject to $Z_{t+1}=Z_t(1-\gamma)+\alpha*q_t$ and $Z_0$ given. Use the following parameter values: $\rho=\frac{1}{1.04}$, p=100, a= 2, b=-0.25,$\gamma=0.2$, $\alpha=2$, and $Z_0$=40. In addition, I want you to ensure that the pollution stock in the last period ($Z_{10}$) is equal to 25. You can think of $Z_{10}$ as a stabilization target, which mimics the goals of the Paris Agreement ( https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement).  To implement $Z_{10}=25$, you will need a constraint just like the one we used to ensure that $q_t \leq R_t$ (HW 1) and $Y_t \leq X_t$ (HW 2).  However, in this case you only need to constrain the final ($t=10$) value.  An equality constraint requires different options than the inequality constraint.  I provide these for you below.  In your nloptr command, you will need to call the constraint with eval_g_eq=name_of_constraint. I also suggest including the lower bound constraint lb=rep(0,period) to ensure that extract is non-negative.    


### A. 

What is the optimal solution? Make a table reporting $t$, $q_t$, $Z_t$, and $\pi_t=\rho^t(pq_t-(aZ_t-bZ_t^2))$.
